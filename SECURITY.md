Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

## Security Best Practices

When using MeetSpot, please follow these security best practices:

### API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration files
- Regularly rotate your Amap API keys
- Use separate API keys for development and production

### Deployment Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Always deploy MeetSpot behind HTTPS in production
- **Input Validation**: The system validates all user inputs, but ensure your deployment does too
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to admin endpoints and configuration files

### Configuration Security
- Keep your `config/config.toml` file secure and never expose it publicly
- Use strong, unique passwords for any authentication systems
- Regularly update dependencies to get security patches

### Monitoring
- Monitor your logs for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for unusual usage patterns
- Regularly review access logs

## Known Security Considerations

### API Rate Limiting
- MeetSpot includes basic rate limiting, but additional protection may be needed for high-traffic deployments
- Consider implementing additional DDoS protection

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Location data is processed through secure geocoding APIs
- XSS protection is implemented in frontend components

### Data Privacy
- MeetSpot does not store personal location data permanently
- All location queries are processed in real-time and not logged
- Consider local privacy laws when deploying
